# linkedin_crawler
Linkedin crawler to collect user profiles data, such as name, organization and current role.

The crawler works as a Chrome extension.
Tested in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

Keep in mind that Linkedin changes its layout from time to time so the extension may stop working and a new extension version must be released.

Let me know if it happens to you and you if you have any ideas to improve this tool. =)

## Install
The extension is not published yet, so to install it you have to access 'Manage extensions' and activate 'Developper mode'. 
Once activated, load the directory with the files in this project and enable the extension.

## How to use it
With the extension enabled, open linkedin user profile URL to automatically add it to a list in memory.
After you are done, click on the extension and export the list in CSV format.

## TODO
Currently very limited to a specific window width. In further updates it will handle those issues.
